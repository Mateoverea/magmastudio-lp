# Magma Studio - Development Rules

## 📌 Project Description
Magma Studio is a Mexican web design and development company based in Guadalajara, Jalisco.  focused on creating **modern and minimalist landing pages, ecommerce pages, apps and programs** with high performance and impactful aesthetics. We draw inspiration from lava, combining intense colors with a clean and functional design.

Our goal is to deliver **highly optimized, responsive, and scalable websites**, ensuring the best experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

All the content must be in spanish.

## 🎨 Color Palette
Magma Studio's visual identity is based on the energy and fluidity of lava. The main colors are:

```yaml
Primary Colors:
  - Lava Red: "#7a290e"
  - Volcanic Orange: "#d85a00"

Secondary Colors:
  - Deep Black: "#1A1A1A"
  - Ash Gray: "#333333"
  - Pure White: "#FFFFFF"
```

### 🔥 Aesthetics
- **Minimalism:** Clean designs without unnecessary elements.
- **Strong Contrast:** Dark backgrounds with warm colors to highlight key information.
- **Modern Typography:** Preference for sleek sans-serif fonts like `Inter`, `Poppins`, or `Montserrat`.
- **Subtle Animations:** Smooth micro-interactions to enhance UX without overloading.

## 📱 Responsiveness
The site must function perfectly on:

```yaml
Devices:
  - Desktops: ">1440px"
  - Tablets: "768px - 1024px"
  - Mobile devices: "320px - 768px"
```

A **Mobile-First** approach must be implemented, ensuring fast and optimized loading on mobile devices before scaling to larger screens.
